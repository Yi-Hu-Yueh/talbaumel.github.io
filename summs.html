</h2><h3>for user:gilboafr.p</h3><h4>for the 'asthma causes' query the summary is:</h4>Asthma is a chronic (long-term), non-curable lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. This makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain substances that are breathed in. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten the airways narrow and less air flows to the lungs. The swelling also can worsen the airways condition, by making them even narrower. As of 2009, 300 million people worldwide were affected by asthma leading to approximately 250,000 deaths per year. More boys have asthma than girls, but more women have it than men. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance and for others it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. What Causes Asthma? The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include: An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe), Parents who have asthma, Certain respiratory infections during childhood, Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing If asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke), Having a mother who smoked while pregnant, Being overweight, Exposure to pollution, Exposure to occupational triggers (such as chemicals used in farming), hairdressing and manufacturing, Low birth weight, animal dander, dust mites and mold Certain foods, Insect stings, Medications, Latex or other substances you touch, which can cause allergic skin reactions. However, more research is needed to determine what role they may play in developing asthma. <br>
<h4>for the 'asthma allergy' query the summary is:</h4>An allergy starts when the immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a dangerous invader and produces antibodies that are always on the alert for your particular allergen. When you're exposed to the allergen again in the future, these antibodies release a number of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms. Having an allergy increases the risk of certain medical problems, such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, including Asthma (an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing). In many cases, allergies and asthma often occur together. So, If you have an allergy, you're more likely to have asthma. Asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment (called allergy-induced asthma or allergic asthma). Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma, affecting over 50% of the 20 million asthma sufferers. Substances such as pollen, dust mites, mold and pet dander are common triggers. In some people, skin or food allergies can cause asthma symptoms. The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis a potentially life-threatening emergency. If you have asthma, you may react to just one trigger or you may find that several things act as triggers. With today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. However, recognizing and avoiding the allergic substances that trigger your symptoms is the most important step you can take.<br>
<h4>for the 'asthma mold allergy
' query the summary is:</h4>What Is Mold Allergy? Mold and mildew are fungi. They differ from plants or animals in how they reproduce and grow. The "seeds" called spores, are spread by the wind outdoors and by air indoors. Some spores are released in dry, windy weather and others are released with the fog or dew when humidity is high. Inhaling the spores causes allergic reactions in some people. Although there are many types of molds, only a few dozen cause allergic reactions.
Mold spores can deposit on the lining of the nose and cause high fever symptoms.They also can reach the lungs, to cause asthma or another serious illness called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. It is common for people to be at greater risk of developing mold allergy if they or other family members are allergic to substances such as pollen or animal dander or if their occupations includ more exposure to mold (for example: Farmers, dairymen, loggers, bakers, mill workers, carpenters, greenhouse employees, wine makers and furniture repairers). The symptoms of mold allergy are very similar to the symptoms of other allergies, such as sneezing, itching, nasal discharge, congestion and dry, scaling skin. In some people with allergy, irritation alone can cause a reaction. To diagnose an allergy to mold or fungi, the doctor will take a complete medical history, skin tests and use the physical examination all together. How Is Mold Allergy Treated? As with most allergies, patients should take some actions to avoid contact with the spores (for example: Wear a dust mask when cutting grass, digging around plants, picking up leaves, disturbing other plant materials and reduce the humidity indoors to 35%). <br>
<h3>for user:ingaisa89@gmail.com.p</h3><h4>for the 'asthma causes' query the summary is:</h4> Asthma is commonly divided into two types: allergic (extrinsic) asthma and non-allergic (intrinsic) asthma. Researchers think a combination of factors (family genes and certain environmental exposures) interact to cause asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:  Airborne allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, mold, cockroaches and dust mites Allergic reactions to some foods, such as peanuts or shellfish Respiratory infections, such as the common cold Physical activity (exercise-induced asthma) Cold air Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve) Strong emotions and stress Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat Menstrual cycle in some women. If you have an allergy, you\'re more likely to have asthma  an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing.<br>
<h4>for the 'asthma allergy' query the summary is:</h4> Most, but not all, people who have asthma have allergies. Allergens Animal Dander Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander.This is called allergic asthma or allergy-induced asthma. Allergies and asthma often occur together.  Common allergy triggers include:  Airborne allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mold Certain foods, particularly peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk Insect stings, such as bee stings or wasp stings Medications, particularly penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics Latex or other substances you touch, which can cause allergic skin reactions. Allergies and asthma often occur together. This is called allergic asthma or allergy-induced asthma. The same substances that trigger your hay fever symptoms may also cause asthma signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing and chest tightness. In many cases, asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment (allergy-induced asthma). If you have an allergy, you're more likely to have asthma  an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing.  In many cases, asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment (allergy-induced asthma). A few treatments can help with both conditions.<br>
<h4>for the 'asthma mold allergy
' query the summary is:</h4> Molds are microscopic fungi that live on plant and animal matter. Molds can be found almost anywhere when moisture is present. Mold spores float through the indoor and outdoor air continually. For people sensitive to molds, inhaling mold spores can trigger an asthma attack.  Mold is among the most hazardous household substances for people with allergies and asthma. They also can reach the lungs, to cause asthma or another serious illness called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. If you have an allergy, you\'re more likely to have asthma  an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing. In many cases, asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment (allergy-induced asthma). How To Control Things That Make Your Asthma Worse: Indoor Mold Fix leaky faucets, pipes, or other sources of water that have mold around them. Clean moldy surfaces with a cleaner that has bleach in it. Stay indoors with windows closed from late morning to afternoon, if you can. Clean damp areas in the bath, kitchen and around the house to keep mold spores from developing. Get rid of moldy leaves or damp firewood in the yard.<br>
<h3>for user:nbabkoff@gmail.com.p</h3><h4>for the 'asthma causes' query the summary is:</h4> Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air. This can cause wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and trouble breathing, especially early in the morning or at night. When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it's called an asthma attack .The exact cause of asthma isn't known, Different factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people  than in others.Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include: An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe), Parents who have asthma, Certain respiratory infections during childhood, Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing. If you have asthma, you may react to just one trigger or you may find that several things act as triggers. (Triggers are things that can cause asthma symptoms)  If you have asthma, you may react to just one trigger or you may find that several things act as triggers. Some common triggers are: Getting a cold or flu Pollen, dust and animals (especially cats) Cold weather, Smoking, Exercise.   <br>
<h4>for the 'asthma allergy' query the summary is:</h4> Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma, affecting over 50% of the 20 million asthma sufferers.Over 2.5 million children under age 18 suffer from allergic asthma. Many of the symptoms of allergic and non-allergic asthma are the same (coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or rapid breathing, and chest tightness). However, allergic asthma is triggered by inhaled allergens such as dust mite allergen, pet dander, pollen, mold, etc. resulting in asthma symptoms. An allergic response occurs when immune system chemicals (antibodies) mistakenly identify a harmless substance as a dangerous invader. In an attempt to protect your body from the substance, antibodies attack the allergen. The chemicals released by your immune system lead to allergy signs and symptoms, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes or skin reactions. For some people, this same reaction also affects the lungs and airways, leading to asthma symptoms. Common allergy triggers include:  Airborne allergens, animal dander, dust mites and mold. Certain foods, Insect stings and certain Medications. While allergies can't be cured, a number of treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms. A few treatments can help with both conditions. For example:  Leukotriene modifier- a daily pill that helps control your immune system chemicals released during an allergic reaction, Allergy shots (immunotherapy) that can help treat asthma by gradually reducing your immune system response to certain allergy triggers. Your immune system builds up a tolerance to the allergens over time, and your allergic reactions diminish. In turn, asthma symptoms decrease as well.<br>

Allergic symptoms from fungus spores are most common from July to late summer, But with fungi growing in so many places, allergic reactions can occur year round. The symptoms are very similar to the symptoms of other allergies, such as sneezing, itching, nasal discharge, congestion and dry, scaling skin.  It is common for people to get mold allergy if they or other family members are allergic to substances such as pollen or animal dander. Some people with mold allergies may have allergy symptoms the entire summer because of outdoor molds or year-round if symptoms are due to indoor molds. Molds can reach the lungs, to cause asthma or another serious illness called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Sometimes the reaction is immediate, and sometimes the reaction is delayed. Symptoms often worsen in a damp or moldy room such as a basement; this may suggest mold allergy.<br>

The exact cause of asthma isn't known. Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in triggering asthma attacks. Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include: An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy, parents who have asthma, certain respiratory infections during childhood, contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing. Young children who often wheeze and have respiratory infections as well as certain other risk factors are at a higher risk of developing asthma. Some people develop asthma because of contact with certain chemical irritants or industrial dusts in the workplace. Smoke from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces contain a mixture of harmful gases and small particles that can cause asthma attacks and severe bronchitis. Outdoor air pollution and pollen may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma.  Droppings or body parts of cockroaches and other pests can trigger asthma. 
One theory for the cause of the increase in asthma prevalence worldwide is the that the rise in the prevalence of allergies and asthma is a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure to a wide variety of different bacteria and virus types in modern societies, or modern hygienic practices preventing childhood infections.

</h2><h3>for user:ingaisa89@gmail.com.p</h3><h4>for the 'asthma treatment' query the summary is:</h4> The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease and prevent asthma attacks. It is treated with two types of medicines: longterm control and quickrelief medicines. Longterm control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quickrelief, or rescue, medicines relieve asthma symptoms when they flare up. An asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding factors that worsen your asthma, tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening asthma, and seeking emergency care when  needed. Good asthma control will: Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath Reduce your need for quickrelief medicines Help you maintain good lung function Let you maintain your normal activity levels and sleep through the night Prevent asthma attacks that could result in  your going to the emergency room or being admitted to the hospital for treatment  To reach this goal, you should actively partner with your doctor to manage the disease and create and follow an asthma action plan. Your initial asthma treatment will depend on how severe your disease is. Asthma can\'t be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it\'s important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.<br>
<h4>for the 'asthma medication' query the summary is:</h4> A variety of asthma inhalers are available to help control asthma symptoms in adults and children. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICATIONS (also known as short-acting bronchodilators) are taken when needed for rapid, short-term relief of asthma symptoms. LONG-TERM CONTROL MEDICATIONS are usually taken daily to control underlying airway inflammation and thereby prevent asthma symptoms.Types of asthma inhalers include:  Metered dose inhalers. Dry powder inhaler. Metered dose inhaler with a spacer.  Take the medication exactly as prescribed. Don't stop taking the medication or adjust the dosage on your own. Types of quick-relief medications include:  Short-acting beta agonists. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA) and pirbuterol (Maxair). Ipratropium (Atrovent). Ipratropium (Atrovent). Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium acts quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids. Allergy medications may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. Inhaled corticosteroids These anti-inflammatory drugs are the most effective and commonly used long-term control medications for asthma.<br>
<h4>for the 'corticosteroids
' query the summary is:</h4> Corticosteroids are medicines that help prevent asthma symptoms occurring by reducing the inflammation in the airways. Cortisone, is part of a family of substances known as steroids which are produced by the body to help it function normally. It reduces itching, swelling, redness, and allergic reactions, used in treating skin problems, severe allergies, asthma and arthritis. Inhaled corticosteroids are prescribed for patients of all ages to treat different levels of persistent asthma. To be effective, they need to be taken once or twice every day as prescribed by your doctor. Inhaled steroids are not addictive. The dose is carefully worked out according to you/your childs weight. Its best to give each dose of steroid with food in the morning, usually at breakfast time. Steroids given by mouth During severe acute asthma episodes you/your child may need a higher dose of corticosteroids to be taken by mouth. A larger dose of steroid taken this way allows the medicine to work faster. These anti-inflammatory drugs are the most effective and commonly used long-term control medications for asthma. Corticosteroids don't generally cause serious side effects. After you use it, rinse your mouth with water, gargle, and spit out. Corticosteroid creams or ointments. Your doctor may recommend prescription corticosteroid creams or ointments to ease scaling and relieve itching. Some people on inhaled corticosteroids may have local side effects such as: sore throat, husky voice, thrush (an infection) in the mouth. Inhaled steroids are not addictive.<br>
<h3>for user:nbabkoff@gmail.com.p</h3><h4>for the 'asthma treatment' query the summary is:</h4> Asthma is a longterm lung disease that cant be cured.It causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making them swollen and  very sensitive. That can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms may include wheezing , chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. When symptoms get more intense and/or additional symptoms occur, this is an asthma attack. Its important to treat symptoms when you first notice them. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack that may require emergency care, and can cause death.  Asthma is treated with two types of medicines:   longterm control and quickrelief medicines. Longterm control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quickrelief, or rescue, medicines relieve asthma symptoms when they flare up. Your initial asthma treatment will depend on how severe your disease is. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is working to control your symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease and prevent asthma attacks. Good asthma control will Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as shortness of breath, Reduce your need for quickrelief medicines, Let you maintain your normal activity levels and sleep through the night and will Prevent severe asthma attacks. To reach this goal, you should actively partner with your doctor to manage the disease and create and follow an asthma action plan. With todays knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease.<br>
<h4>for the 'asthma medication' query the summary is:</h4> Prevention and long-term control are key in stopping asthma attacks before they start. Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers and taking steps to avoid them, and tracking your breathing to make sure your daily asthma medications are keeping symptoms under control. In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol.  The right medications for you depend on a number of things, including your age, symptoms, your asthma triggers and what seems to work best to keep your asthma under control. Preventive, long-term control medications reduce the inflammation in your airways that leads to symptoms.They are taken daily and are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary. Long term medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely to have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include:  Inhaled corticosteroids. You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Quick-relief medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack  or before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include:  Short-acting beta agonists. These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. But if your long-term control medications are working properly, you shouldn't need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often.<br>
<h4>for the 'corticosteroids
' query the summary is:</h4> Corticosteroids are medicines that help prevent asthma symptoms occurring by reducing the inflammation in the airways. Cortisone, is part of a family of substances known as steroids which are produced by the body to help it function normally. Corticosteroids were developed from cortisone and are agents that decrease inflammation. The medication is used in several forms, to treat many different conditions. It reduces itching, swelling, redness, and allergic reactions, used in treating skin problems, severe allergies, asthma and arthritis. Inhaled corticosteroids are a maintenance medicine that helps to prevent severe asthma symptoms. They are prescribed for patients of all ages to treat different levels of persistent asthma. They work by dampening down the inflammation in the airways, and are the most effective agents for treating asthma. As a result, asthma symptoms and sudden acute attacks occur less often. To be effective, they need to be taken once or twice every day as prescribed by your doctor. They are of no benefit when used for symptoms, unlike bronchodilators, or when taken on an odd occasion. Common Corticosteroids: Beclozone (Beclomethasone), Flixotide (Fluticasone), Pulmicort (Budesonide). Some preventers may take 3 to 4 weeks to become effective others only take a few days, so it may take some time before you notice a difference in your your asthma. Some people on inhaled corticosteroids may have local side effects such as sore throat, husky voice, thrush (an infection) in the mouth. These side effects can be avoided by using a spacer.<br>

</h2><h3>for user:gilboafr.p</h3><h4>for the 'exercise induced asthma' query the summary is:</h4>In addition to chronic asthma another condition is Exercise Induced Asthma or (EIA) when physical activities is the only trigger causing narrowing of the airways, and producing the symptoms of asthma. This condition is Non-Allergic (intrinsic) asthma that triggered by factors not related to allergies, in this case: exercise. Exercise induced asthma is a relatively common problem that can go undiagnosed, as some attribute their symptoms to being unfit. Exercise-induced asthma, may be worse when the air is cold so there is a need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often for some people. If you have any of these symptoms during or after playing sport or exercising/activities, you may be experiencing EIA: shortness of breath a few minutes after starting to exercise/play sport, tight feeling in chest while playing a sport/exercising/active, stopping exercise/sport/activity because you feel unwell Wheezing and/or coughing. If you think you may have any of the signs of EIA and have not been diagnosed with asthma, please contact your family doctor for advice. Being active is important for people with asthma as it helps in the management of the condition. Exercise helps to strengthen the muscles used for breathing, and over time may even help to improve your EIA symptoms.  Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.<br>
<h4>for the 'exercise for asthmatic' query the summary is:</h4>If you exercise in cold temperatures, wear a face mask to warm the air you breathe. To help prevent symptoms: Take two puffs of your blue reliever inhaler before warming up Do some warm-up exercise e.g. gentle exercises and stretching for 5-10 minutes. This will help to increase your heart and breathing rates gradually lessening the effects of the cold air Now you are ready to start  If you experience symptoms during playing sport/exercising: STOP and take some slow, deep breaths Take four puffs of blue inhaler (one at a time), using a spacer if accessible Return to activity if you are free of symptoms  If your symptoms continue or return after your recommence, repeat inhaler instructions and see a doctor as soon as possible.  At times, programs for students who have asthma may need to be temporarily modified, such as by varying the type, intensity, duration, and/or frequency of activity. At all times, students who have asthma should be included in activities as much as possible. The good news is that today\'s treatments can successfully control asthma so that most students can participate fully in regular school and childcare activities, including play, sports, and other physical activities.<br>
<h4>for the 'exercise to treat asthma
' query the summary is:</h4>Breathing exercises: Breathing techniques for asthma have been around for years, but many health providers remain skeptical about them. They don't seem to improve the underlying allergic reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Nonetheless, in a number of studies, people who did breathing exercises reported improved symptoms. Breathing methods vary, but generally involve learning to: take breaths less often, take slower breaths, breathe through your nose rather than your mouth, use your abdominal muscles to take deep "belly breaths" (diaphragmatic breathing). A few breathing techniques used for asthma include the Buteyko breathing technique and yoga breathing (pranayama). Inspiratory muscle training: this technique helps strengthen lung muscles with a series of breathing exercises. These exercises definitely strengthen the muscles of your lungs, but there's not enough proof to say whether they help with asthma. Massage and chiropractic treatment Although some claim that these treatments help, there's no evidence that physical manipulation of the spine or muscles reduces asthma symptoms. Regular exercise can strengthen your heart and lungs, which helps relieve asthma symptoms. Relaxation therapy Relaxation therapy techniques include meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis and progressive muscle relaxation. It's unclear whether any of these techniques directly help with asthma, but they do seem to reduce stress and promote a sense of well-being.<br>
